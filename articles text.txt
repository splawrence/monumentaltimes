Welcome to
Monumental
Times!
You have happened upon
the inaugural issue of a new,
up-and-coming newspaper
filled with all your favorite
things – stories, testimonies,
quotes, laughs, and more!
Where did it all come from?
I’
m glad you asked.
Throughout the Bible, God
has always emphasized the
importance of remembering.
He commanded the Israelites
to set up monuments of stone
to mark significant moments in
their history (Joshua 4:1-24).
He reminded them time and
time again to write scripture on
our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33).
Much of the Bible itself is full of
historical accounts reminding
us of God’
s work throughout
the ages.
Amy Carmichael, missionary
to India in the early 1900s,
recognized how important this
was. When she still lived in
Ireland and England, she
published a small magazine
called “Scraps
” to remind
family and friends of spiritual
truths. Looking back at
“Scraps
” is one of the ways
we can look into the life of the
missionary and see how God
brought her from there to
eventually impacting so many
lives in India.
This newspaper began with
that same vision in mind:
remembering what God has
done. Far too often in our busy
lives we forget to remember
the things God is working all
around us. In this publication
you will find that everything
written or created has that
driving purpose behind it:
Remember! It is a call to be
intentional, to write down and
record in our own
“
piles of
stones
”
what our Father in
heaven is doing among His
children... those Monumental
moments in our lives. So, sit
back, relax, and remember
with us as we press on to
chronicle our faith and wield
our pen as valiant warriors in
a world so prone to forget.

Did You Know?
A Wild Tail
by Andrew Rocke
OP–ED
So, I’
m the kind of person
that when I watch a movie or
hear about something that
interests me, I’ll often do a little
online research to learn more
about the topic. Recently, my
wife and I watched the movie
Rascal together. It is based on
the book with a similar name.
We had briefly talked about it
for a few minutes afterwards
when I took up my computer to
do a little investigation.
Rascal: A Memoir of a Better
Era was written by Sterling
North in 1963. It is based on
his childhood experience of
raising a baby raccoon in
Wisconsin during World War
I. The book won several
awards, and the movie was
made in 1969. As I perused
the Wikipedia article, I noticed
that a Japanese anime series
called Araiguma Rasukaru was
based on the book and “
was
responsible for the accidental
introduction of the raccoon into
Japan.”¹ That piqued my
interest.
A short internet search found
a 2024 Fox News article
entitled:
“Japan grappling with
invasive raccoon population.”
Sure enough, the 1977 anime
called Rascal the Raccoon (in
English) was responsible for
the importation of raccoons as
pets (hey, they are kind of cute
– as long as you don
’t think
about all the damage they do
and problems they cause). As
could be imagined, the
Japanese owners discovered
that raccoons don
’t make
good pets. When quoting
aime Arslan, a raccoon
owner, the article says:
“Raccoons... '
can be very
destructive in a home
'
and
need to be constantly
entertained. Additionally,
raccoons
'
can and will bite,
'
either as aggression or as a
form of play.
Their care, too, is extremely
expensive, as most
veterinarians will not see a
raccoon.”²
So, history repeated itself
and the Japanese did what
Sterling had to do with his
raccoon: they let them go in
the wild. ◆

On Prayer
by Joanna Rocke
PRAYER
Prayer is by far one of the
most crucial aspects of the
Christian life. How are we to
know God, be transformed to
be like Christ, or battle for
Him, if we never talk to Him?
Indeed, half the battle is won
when we put our lives into His
hands instead of holding on to
it ourselves. The lack of prayer
reflects a false trust in
ourselves. What a foolish
choice!
Prayer requires us to come
humbly before God. Psalm
139:23-24 is a great place to
start as we humble ourselves
and turn to God. As you pray
in the next weeks, pray this
scripture and allow God to
convict you of sin and restore
you to truth. I have found
praying this scripture frequently
to be a good reminder of my
condition, God’
s love, and my
need for Him.
————————————
“Search me, O God, and
know my heart; try me, and
know my anxieties; and see if
there is any wicked way in
me, and lead me in the way
everlasting.”
Psalm 139:23-24

VOICES FROM HISTORY
You meet me in the quiet lonely places
Where the rain falls down like dust
You whisper songs of comfort
And quiet words of trust
You conquer every lie with truth
And cast aside my fear
And when I am at my loneliest
Is when You, Lord, appear
My heart is in Your hands, my Lord
My life is at Your call
Make my desires only Yours
I give You, Lord, my all
The howling wind and pouring rain
Falls down hard and fast
But Lord You promise deliverance
And perfect joy at last
I wait for You, for in Your time
You weave a kingdom song
In every pause and every note
Your melody grows strong
In the while, in this world
There will be tears and pain
There will be suffering and loss
But He will come again
And so, my patient longing lasts
But one day it will cease
In fellowship with You at last
And everlasting peace ◆
I Give You
Lord My All
POETRY
Ephesians
3:14-21
SCRIPTURE
For this reason I bow my knees to the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom
the whole family in heaven and earth is
named, that He would grant you, according
to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened
with might through His Spirit in the inner
man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith; that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to
comprehend with all the saints what is the
width and length and depth and height— to
know the love of Christ which passes
knowledge; that you may be filled with all
the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able
to do exceedingly abundantly above all that
we ask or think, according to the power that
works in us, to Him be glory in the church by
Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and
ever. Amen.
A Girl by the
Seaside
by Hope Hanson
STORYTIME
She ran along the shore, a squeal of delight
escaping her lips at every shell she came upon.
One chubby fist held the edge of her blue skirt in
a bundle, creating a little pouch to hold her
treasures. Silver shells, white shells, blue shells,
perfect shells, soft shells, big shells, small shells.
Broken shells too. All slipped into the makeshift
bag. She sat upon the sun warmed beach,
wiggling her toes in the soft sand. One by one,
she laid the shells out on the ground as the icy
cold waves leapt against the shore of Lake
Michigan a little ways in front of her. Her rosy
cheeks spread in a wide, contented smile. A
gusty wind blew across her face, whipping stray
blond hairs wildly like the brown and green
grasses around her.
by Hope Hanson
—————————————
She wishes for a shell to find
Along the golden sand,
A treasure with worth beyond
all measure
To hold within her hand.
A child’
s treasure in a shell
Is greater than a miser
’
s gold,
For God made shells and trees
and grass
Real treasures to behold.
But even these cannot compare
To God’
s ultimate treasure.
Eternity with Him above
And joy beyond all measure!

“God always gives His best to
those who leave the choice with
Him.”
Jim Elliot
“Today I know that such memories
are the key not to the past, but to
the future. I know that the
experiences of our lives, when we
let God use them, become the
mysterious and perfect preparation
for the work he will give us to do.”
Corrie ten Boom
“The love of God is one of the
great realities of the universe, a
pillar upon which the hope of the
world rests. But it is a personal,
intimate thing, too. God does not
love populations, He loves
people. He loves not masses, but
men. He loves us all with a mighty
love that has no beginning and
can have no end.”

Shadow of the Almighty
The Life & Testament of Jim Elliot
BOOK REVIEW
Review by Hope Hanson
By Elisabeth Elliot
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2025
I have grown up reading the
stories and adventures of the 5
missionaries who travelled to
Ecuador in the 1950s and risked
all to carry the gospel to the
unreached Huaorani (formerly
Auca) people. Jim Elliot and his
four friends Nate Saint, Ed
McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger
Youderian were all killed by the
spear on January 8, 1956, and
this tragedy paved the way for the
people in the remote jungles of
Ecuador to hear the gospel and
has inspired countless others to
pursue mission work in various
capacities since then.
When I first “
picked up
” the
audiobook of Shadow of the
Almighty, I wasn
’t exactly sure
what to expect. Since I already
knew some of the story, I figured I
might hear a lot of the same. But
this book is far from run-of-the-mill.
Elisabeth Elliot masterfully
compiled letters and journal
entries from Jim Elliot throughout
his life, starting in his teens.

This book is about a family living in the

in all the action of her older siblings. It is
fun for many ages or even as a family
read-aloud.
Musical Album
Hold Fast
Steve Green
This album is characterized by a very
majestic and beautiful sound. The first four
tracks are part of a Psalm Suite with Psalms
113-116 sung or read to music. The other
tracks are each unique, but combined send
a message of being grounded in truth. The
album concludes with ‘The Faith by Which
We Stand’
which brings a solid finish to
the theme of holding fast to truth.

Book
Challenge
Do you ever wonder how many books
you
’
ve read in your lifetime? Or perhaps
you can’t remember the name of that
really good book you finished last year
and you can’t find it again. Whatever the
case is, there is an easy solution!
My challenge to you is to keep a book
journal. Every time you finish a book,
write down the Title and Author. For an
extra bonus, write down your thoughts on
the book! Other things to include could
be the length of the book, genre, time it
took you to finish it, or who
recommended it to you. Be creative!
In the years to come, it will be fun to look
back and see what you
’
ve read and how
your reading habits have changed
through the years. It’s also fun to keep
track of how many books you read in a
year! My record was 66, maybe you can
beat it!
Whatever you do, put your own special
spin on it and have fun. Happy reading!
